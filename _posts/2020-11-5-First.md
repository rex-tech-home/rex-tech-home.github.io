title: Moving to GitHub pages + Jekyll
---

I have decided to try technical blogging here.

I hate having to learn a bunch of new stuff, just to do the simplest of things. But, that is the way of the world.

But, here are the things I did:
- cloned the repo from [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub
- learned about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): starting at the [Step by Step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)
  - I did not install Ruby, etc. on my PC: GitHub takes care of all that. All I have to do is update the files from the clone
  
Shoutout to [Doug](https://dougbreaux.github.io/) for his help..
